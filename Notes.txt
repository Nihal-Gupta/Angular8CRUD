 ===========
 Rouiting is important . The path variable defined in app-module.ts, you have to use same path in app.component.html as routerlink, for navigating to that perticular angular conponenet. i use routerlink so far, there is other way too, keep exporing

=====Need to dig more on this creating backedn api
Creating api angular service which will run on node JS, we done angualr JS8 front end programming , now node Js backkedn we are doing
steps:
npm init -y   == This will cerate package.json , necessory for build

npm install express body-parser cors mongoose --save  ==npm install express body-parser cors mongoose --save  

npm install nodemon --save-dev   == to start the sever node js, we dont need to start the server again again


Coding is same like angular js, you need to create models , routes folder and configuration 

Server.js is the file created form backedn service, if npm start console will be closed, then server will throw error and you wont be able to click submit button
